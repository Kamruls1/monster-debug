                    Changes made are saved and

            <ul class="ans">
                <li>Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. <br> A
                    code
                    block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). <br> if statement, loops,
                    function
                    are examples of structure that create a code block. <br> A global variable has global scope. A
                    global
                    variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. <br> A local variable has
                    local
                    scope. <br> A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.

            <ul class="ans">
                <li>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear <br>
                    before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. <br>
                    Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers <br>
                    and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks.

                    If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, <br>
                    waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
